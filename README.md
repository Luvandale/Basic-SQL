# Basic-SQL

For the practice below, I used the following database: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Qsnn3bg0_PYgY5kKJOUDG8xdKLvOLPK/view?usp=sharing. The different questions(as comments) and SQL output are in the respective files.

I accessed the database through Biq query, which I used to run my SQL queries.

The database consists of six schemas, each consisting of different tables joined on different primary and foreign keys

dbo
purchasing
person
production
human resources and sales
